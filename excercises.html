        <h2>1. Introduction to Programming in Python</h2>
        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>An Algorithm is the logical blueprint (finite, unambiguous steps) for solving a problem, independent of any language. The Program is the source code implementation of that algorithm. Syntax is the language's grammar (rules); Semantics is the code's meaning (logic). Python uses an Interpreter (specifically a Python Virtual Machine that executes intermediate bytecode), which translates and executes code line-by-line at runtime, making development rapid but execution typically slower than compiled languages.</p>
        </div>

                <li>After installing Python, use the interpreter in interactive mode (typing <code>python</code> in your terminal) to run a line of code immediately.</li>

            <p>IDEs (like PyCharm) provide advanced features like context-aware code completion and integrated debugging, enhancing developer productivity far beyond a simple text editor. Git is a distributed version control system that tracks the history of every line of code; GitHub is the popular cloud platform for collaborating on and hosting Git repositories. Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, ensuring project A doesn't break when installing a new version needed by project B.</p>

        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Python's Numeric types handle numbers with special consideration for <code>float</code> precision due to binary representation issues. Sequence types (<code>list</code>, <code>tuple</code>) maintain order. Lists are mutable (can change in place), while Tuples are immutable, making them ideal for fixed data. Dictionaries (<code>dict</code>) use hashing on immutable keys to achieve $O(1)$ (constant time) average retrieval speed, making them exceptionally fast for lookups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="exercises">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ’»</span> Exercises (Deeper Focus)</h3>

                <li>Calculate the volume of a cylinder given a radius $r$ and height $h$, using a combination of arithmetic operators and the <code>float</code> type.</li>
                <li>Use comparison and logical operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>) to check if a user's age is between 18 and 65, inclusive, but not exactly 30.</li>

        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>The core concept of I/O is the interaction with external resources. The <code>input()</code> function always returns a string, necessitating type casting (e.g., <code>int(input())</code>) for numerical data. The <code>print()</code> function uses arguments like <code>sep</code> (separator) and <code>end</code> (ending character) to control output appearance beyond the default space and newline. f-strings are evaluated at runtime, embedding variable values as the string is constructed.</p>

        <div class="exercises">

                <li>Ask the user for their name and preferred greeting (e.g., "Hello,", "Welcome,") and use f-strings to combine the input into a custom message.</li>
                <li>Compute the sum and product of two numbers input by the user, displaying the results in a single <code>print()</code> statement using the <code>sep</code> argument.</li>
                <li>Read a monetary value from the user (as a string), convert it to a float, and use f-string formatting to display it rounded to two decimal places and prefixed with a dollar sign.</li>

            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Flow control determines the program's path through conditional execution (<code>if/elif/else</code>) or repetition (loops). The <code>for</code> loop is definite iteration (knows how many times to run, usually over a sequence). The <code>while</code> loop is indefinite iteration (runs until a condition is met). <code>break</code> terminates the entire loop; <code>continue</code> skips only the current iteration.</p>

        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Modular programming involves breaking code into distinct, reusable Modules (<code>.py</code> files). Packages are directories of related modules, essential for structuring large projects and preventing name clashes. Namespaces are mapping systems (like dictionaries) that keep track of names (variables, functions) and the objects they reference, ensuring no ambiguity. Scope (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in - LEGB) dictates which namespaces are searched, and in what order, when resolving a variable name.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create a module named <code>utils.py</code> with functions for calculating area and perimeter. In your main script, <code>import utils</code> and call one of the functions to demonstrate module usage.</li>
                <li>Create a folder hierarchy to structure a package with a main file and two sub-modules, and use dot notation (e.g., <code>from package.submodule import func</code>) to call a function.</li>
                <li>Write a function with a variable named <code>x</code>, and an outer script with a global variable <code>x</code>. Inside the function, print <code>x</code> and explain which scope's <code>x</code> was used based on the LEGB rule.</li>

        <h2>7. Functions</h2>
        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Functions promote Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) code by encapsulating logic for reuse. Default arguments (e.g., <code>def func(a=1)</code>) must be defined after non-default arguments. Recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken into smaller, identical subproblems, but it requires a careful base case to prevent infinite loops (Stack Overflow). Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression that is returned implicitly, making them concise for simple operations.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Write a function that computes the average of a list, ensuring it handles the case of an empty list to prevent a ZeroDivisionError (using an <code>if</code> statement).</li>
                <li>Implement the recursive Fibonacci sequence function, tracing the function calls for <code>fib(4)</code> to clearly illustrate the call stack and the base case.</li>
                <li>Use <code>filter()</code> with a lambda function to select and return only the odd numbers from a given list of integers.</li>

        <h2>8. References and Pointers (Python Context)</h2>
        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Python variables are names bound to objects. When you assign <code>b = a</code>, you create a second reference (label) to the exact same object in memory. Mutability (the ability of an object to change in place) is key: changing a mutable object affects all names referencing it, while reassigning an immutable object simply binds the name to a new object. The <code>id()</code> function provides the unique memory address (identity) of an object.</p>

        <div class="exercises">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ’»</span> Exercises (Deeper Focus)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Initialize a list <code>a = [1, 2]</code> and set <code>b = a</code>. Modify <code>b[0] = 99</code>. Print both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to show the reference effect (both changed). Then, start over, use <code>a = b.copy()</code>, modify <code>b</code>, and show that <code>a</code> is now independent.</li>
                <li>Write a function that takes a list, appends an item to it, and does not return anything. Call the function using a global list and explain why the global list was permanently modified.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate why <code>1000 is 1000</code> might return <code>False</code> but <code>5 is 5</code> returns <code>True</code> (due to Python's optimization for small, frequently used integers).</li>

        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Choosing the right data structure is critical for performance. Lists are best for ordered sequences where insertion and deletion are common. Tuples are best for fixed records or when used as dictionary keys (because they are immutable and hashable). Sets are optimized for membership testing and removing duplicates quickly. Dictionaries are the primary mapping type, utilizing keys for fast, non-sequential access.</p>

        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Searching finds a target element; Sorting arranges elements in order. Time Complexity measures how the runtime grows with the input size $n$. Linear Search is $O(n)$, while Binary Search is $O(\log n)$, making it exponentially faster for large, sorted data. Simple sorts like Bubble Sort are $O(n^2)$ (quadratic), whereas professional algorithms like Merge Sort and Timsort (used by Python) achieve $O(n \log n)$, which is considered efficient.</p>

        <div class="theory">
            <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ“˜</span> Theory (Deeper Concepts)</h3>
            <p>Python strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters, allowing them to handle most global languages. Because they are immutable, operations like concatenation (<code>s + "more"</code>) create entirely new string objects. Slicing (<code>s[start:stop:step]</code>) allows for precise extraction of substrings. Methods like <code>.split()</code> and <code>.join()</code> are often used together to parse complex text formats and then reconstruct them.</p>

                <li>Check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) by using negative slicing (<code>[::-1]</code>) for an efficient one-line solution.</li>
                <li>Given a URL string (e.g., <code>"https://www.google.co.uk/search"</code>), use a combination of <code>.split()</code>, <code>.replace()</code>, and indexing/slicing to extract and print only the root domain name (<code>google</code>).</li>
